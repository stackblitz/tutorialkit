Our HTML looks great, but the default styles leave a lot of room for improvements. Thankfully, the way `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` look like can be customized with a standard CSS.

Here some of these styles have already been applied (note the `border-style: solid` in line #3 – see what changes if you comment it out) but they still need some finishing touches!

Try adjusting the properties of these elements to make each fieldset look like this:

<img src="/images/fieldset-styles.png" class="m-auto my-6 w-full max-w-120">
