import PropertyTable from '@components/PropertyTable.astro'

You can configure the appearance and behavior of a TutorialKit lesson by setting up properties in the [lesson's frontmatter block](/guides/creating-content/#a-lesson-content-file).

## Note on inheritance

Some options, like "title," will naturally be unique for each lesson. For others, like "template," the value might be the same across multiple lessons, chapters, or even an entire tutorial. That's why we've made it possible to set some properties on a **chapter**, **part**, or **tutorial** level. We call these values _inherited_.

For instance, if you set `template: "simple"` for a given **part**, all chapters and lessons in this **part** will use the "simple" template.

It's also possible to override inherited properties on a lower level. For example, if you set `template: "simple"` for a **part**, but `template: "advanced"` for a **lesson**, that specific lesson will use the "advanced" template.

## Configuration location

- In case of a **lesson**, set the configuration in the frontmatter of the `content.md` file.
- For a **chapter**, **part** or the whole **tutorial**, set the configuration in the frontmatter of the `meta.md` file on the respective level.

```

##### `focus`
Defines which file should be opened in the [code editor](/guides/ui/#code-editor) by default when lesson loads.
<PropertyTable inherited type="string" />

##### `editor`
Configures options for the editor and its file tree. Editor can be hidden by providing `false`.
Optionally you can hide just file tree by providing `fileTree: false`.

File tree can be set to allow file editing from right clicks by setting `fileTree.allowEdits: true`.

<PropertyTable inherited type={'Editor'} />

The `Editor` type has the following shape:

```ts
type GlobPattern = string

type Editor =
    | false
    | { editor: { allowEdits: boolean | GlobPattern | GlobPattern[] } }

```

Example values:

```yaml
editor: false # Editor is hidden

editor: # Editor is visible
  fileTree: false # File tree is hidden

editor: # Editor is visible
  fileTree: # File tree is visible
    allowEdits: true # User can add new files and folders from the file tree


editor: # Editor is visible
  fileTree: # File tree is visible
    allowEdits: "/src/**" # User can add files and folders anywhere inside "/src/"

editor: # Editor is visible
  fileTree: # File tree is visible
    allowEdits:
      - "/*" # User can add files and folders directly in the root
      - "/first-level/allowed-filename-only.js" # Only "allowed-filename-only.js" inside "/first-level" folder
      - "**/second-level/**" # Anything inside "second-level" folders anywhere
```

##### `previews`
Configure which ports should be used for the previews allowing you to align the behavior with your demo application's dev server setup. If not specified, the lowest port will be used.

<PropertyTable inherited type={'Preview[]'} />

The `Preview` type has the following shape:

```ts
type Preview =
    | number
    | string
    | [port: number, title: string]
    | [port: number, title: string, pathname: string]
    | { port: number, title: string, pathname?: string }

```

Example value:

```yaml
previews:
  - 3000 # Preview is on :3000/
  - "3001/docs" # Preview is on :3001/docs/
  - [3002, "Dev Server"] # Preview is on :3002/. Displayed title is "Dev Server".
  - [3003, "Dev Server", "/docs"] # Preview is on :3003/docs/. Displayed title is "Dev Server".
  - { port: 3004, title: "Dev Server" } # Preview is on :3004/. Displayed title is "Dev Server".
  - { port: 3005, title: "Dev Server", pathname: "/docs" } # Preview is on :3005/docs/. Displayed title is "Dev Server".
```

##### `mainCommand`
The main command to be executed. This command will run after the `prepareCommands`.
<PropertyTable inherited type="Command" />

The `Command` type has the following shape:

```ts
type Command = string
    | [command: string, title: string]
    | { command: string, title: string }

```

##### `prepareCommands`
List of commands to execute sequentially. They are typically used to install dependencies or to run scripts.
<PropertyTable inherited type="Command[]" />

The `Command` type has the following shape:

```ts
type Command = string
    | [command: string, title: string]
    | { command: string, title: string }

```

##### `filesystem`
Configures how changes such as files being modified or added in WebContainer should be reflected in the editor when they weren't caused by the user directly. By default, the editor will not reflect these changes.

An example use case is when a user runs a command that modifies a file. For instance when a `package.json` is modified by doing an `npm install <xyz>`. If `watch` is set to `true`, the file will be updated in the editor. If set to `false`, the file will not be updated.

This property is by default set to `false` as it can impact performance. If you are creating a lesson where the user is expected to modify files outside the editor, you may want to keep this to `false`.

<PropertyTable inherited type={'FileSystem'} />

The `FileSystem` type has the following shape:

```ts
type FileSystem = {
  watch: boolean
}

```

Example values:

```yaml
filesystem:
  watch: true  # Filesystem changes are reflected in the editor

filesystem:
  watch: false # Or if it's omitted, the default value is false
```


##### `terminal`
Configures one or more terminals. TutorialKit provides two types of terminals: read-only, called `output`, and interactive, called `terminal`. Note, that there can be only one `output` terminal.

You can define which terminal panel will be active by default by specifying the `activePanel` value. The value is the given terminal's position in the `panels` array. If you omit the `activePanel` property, the first panel will be the active one.

You can set terminal open by default by specifying the `open` value.

An interactive terminal will disable the output redirect syntax by default. For instance, you cannot create a file `world.txt` with the contents `hello` using the command `echo hello > world.txt`. The reason is that this could disrupt the lesson if a user overwrites certain files. To allow output redirection, you can change the behavior with the `allowRedirects` setting. You can define this setting either per panel or for all panels at once.

Additionally, you may not want users to run arbitrary commands. For example, if you are creating a lesson about `vitest`, you could specify that the only command the user can run is `vitest` by providing a list of `allowCommands`. Any other command executed by the user will be blocked. You can define the `allowCommands` setting either per panel or for all panels at once.

By default, in every new lesson terminals start a new session. If you want to keep the terminal session between lessons, you can specify the `id` property for a given terminal panel and keep the same `id` across lessons.
<PropertyTable inherited type="Terminal" />

The `Terminal` type has the following shape:

```ts
type Terminal = {
    panels: TerminalPanel[],
    activePanel?: number,
    allowRedirects?: boolean,
    allowCommands?: string[],
    open?: boolean,
}

type TerminalPanel = TerminalType
    | [type: TerminalType, title: string]
    | { type: TerminalType, title?: string, id?: string, allowRedirects?: boolean, allowCommands?: boolean }

type TerminalType = 'terminal' | 'output'

```

Example value:

```yaml
terminal:
  open: true
  activePanel: 1
  panels:
    - ['output', 'Dev Server']
    - type: terminal
      id: 'cmds'
      title: 'Command Line'
      allowRedirects: true
      allowCommands:
        - ls
        - echo

```

##### `autoReload`
Navigating to a lesson that specifies `autoReload` will always reload the preview. This is typically only needed if your server does not support HMR.
<PropertyTable inherited type="boolean" />

##### `template`
Specifies which folder from the `src/templates/` directory should be used as the basis for the code. See the "[Code templates](/guides/creating-content/#code-templates)" guide for a detailed explainer.
<PropertyTable inherited type="string" />

##### `editPageLink`
Display a link in lesson for editing the page content.
The value is a URL pattern where `${path}` is replaced with the lesson's location relative to the `src/content/tutorial`.

<PropertyTable inherited type="string|false" />

```yaml
editPageLink: https://github.com/stackblitz/tutorialkit/blob/main/packages/template/src/content/tutorial/${path}
```

The inherited value can be disabled in specific parts using `false`.

```yaml
editPageLink: false
```

:::tip
Note that Github will try to automatically render the `.md` files when linked to.
You can instruct Github to show the source code instead by adding `plain=1` query parameter.

```diff
-editPageLink: https://github.com/stackblitz/tutorialkit/blob/main/packages/template/src/content/tutorial/${path}
+editPageLink: https://github.com/stackblitz/tutorialkit/blob/main/packages/template/src/content/tutorial/${path}?plain=1
```

:::

##### `openInStackBlitz`
Display a link for opening current lesson in StackBlitz.
<PropertyTable inherited type="OpenInStackBlitz" />

The `OpenInStackBlitz` type has the following shape:

```ts
type OpenInStackBlitz =
    | boolean
    | { projectTitle?: string, projectDescription?: string, projectTemplate?: TemplateType }

type TemplateType = "html" | "node" | "angular-cli" | "create-react-app" | "javascript" | "polymer" | "typescript" | "vue"

```
