# Changelog

All notable changes to the "tutorialkit" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

##Â [0.1.1]

All the following changes are for the Tutorial Panel:

- Add the tutorial as the root element of the tree so that the root metadata can be viewed and edited easily
- Add an "Add Part" action to the context menu of the root element
- Add a "Delete" action to every context menu to remove a part, chapter or lesson
- When the order is defined in the metadata, it is reflected in the panel
- When a new part, chapter or lesson is created if the parent uses the order defined in the metadata, then it gets automatically added there.
