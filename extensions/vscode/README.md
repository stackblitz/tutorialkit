## Description

When designing the content architecture across folders and files, we aimed to make it as plain and clear as possible. However, even the best-thought-out file system organization doesn’t translate perfectly to the more abstract structure of lessons and chapters in a tutorial.

We wanted to make navigating between the different parts of your courseware or creating new lessons even easier than traversing a file system.

For that reason, we’ve decided to build a companion Visual Studio Code extension for tutorial authors. The extension provides a visual representation of your tutorial structure and allows you to create new chapters and lessons. When you navigate through the displayed structure, the extension automatically focuses on the corresponding folders and files in your file explorer, giving you a quick way to jump to the content you want to edit.
